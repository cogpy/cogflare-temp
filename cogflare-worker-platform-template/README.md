# Worker Publisher

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/worker-publisher-template)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

A Cloudflare Worker that creates and deploys Workers to a Dispatch Namespace via the Cloudflare SDK.

## How it works

- Automatically creates a Workers for Platforms dispatch namespace
- Uses Cloudflare SDK to deploy Workers to the namespace
- Each deployed Worker gets its own /{worker-name} path
- Main Worker acts as a router, forwarding requests to deployed Workers
- Each deployed Worker runs in its own isolated environment

You can modify this and use it to deploy static sites or full stack applications at scale, build a vibe coding platform, deploy personalized AI agents ... the possibilities are endless!

<!-- dash-content-end -->

## Setup

After you click "Deploy to Cloudflare", you'll be prompted for:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - Your Cloudflare API token with Workers:Edit permission

# React Router 7 + PostgreSQL + Hyperdrive on Cloudflare Workers

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/react-router-postgres-ssr-template)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This project demonstrates a full-stack application with a React Router app with Server-Side Rendering (SSR), served through Cloudflare Workers. The backend consists of API routes built with Hono, running on Cloudflare Workers, connecting to a PostgreSQL database through Hyperdrive. Smart Placement is enabled to automatically position your Worker closer to your database for reduced latency.

<!-- dash-content-end -->

## Architecture Overview

This application demonstrates a full-stack architecture using Cloudflare Workers:

- **Frontend**: React with React Router 7 for both server and client-side rendering
  - Built with Vite and deployed as assets via Workers
- **Backend**: API routes served by a Worker using Hono framework
  - API endpoints defined in `/api/routes` directory
  - Automatic fallback to mock data when database is unavailable
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database connected via Cloudflare Hyperdrive
  - Smart Placement enabled for optimal performance
  - Handles missing connection strings or connection failures

## Smart Placement Benefits

This application uses Cloudflare Workers' [Smart Placement](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/smart-placement/) feature to optimize performance:

- **What is Smart Placement?** Smart Placement dynamically positions your Worker in Cloudflare's network to minimize latency between your Worker and database.

- **Why it's enabled in this app:** The application makes multiple database round trips per request. Smart Placement analyzes this traffic pattern and can choose to position the Worker and Hyperdrive closer to your deployed database to reduce latency.

- **Performance implications:** This can significantly improve response times, especially for read-intensive operations requiring multiple database queries, as demonstrated in the book-related API endpoints.

- **No configuration needed:** Smart Placement works automatically when enabled in `wrangler.jsonc` with `"mode": "smart"`.

## Rendering Modes

This application uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React Router 7:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Initial page loads are rendered on the server, which improves performance and SEO. This is configured in `react-router.config.js` with `ssr: true`.

2. **Client-Side Navigation**: After the initial server render, React Router takes over for smooth client-side navigation between routes.

3. **API-driven data fetching**: Backend data is retrieved from API endpoints that connect to either:
   - A real PostgreSQL database via Hyperdrive (production mode)
   - Mock data automatically provided when no database is available (demo mode)

## Deployment Options

This application can be deployed in two ways:

### Option 1: With Database (Full Experience)

1. Run `npm i`
2. Sign up for a PostgreSQL provider like [Neon](https://neon.tech) and create a database
3. Load the sample data using the provided SQL script:
   - The `/init.sql` file contains all database schema and sample data
   - You can either:
     - Copy and paste the contents into your database provider's SQL editor
     - Or use a command line tool like `psql`: `psql -h hostname -U username -d dbname -f init.sql`
4. Create a Hyperdrive connection by running:
   ```
   npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="<postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name>"
   ```
5. Uncomment and update the Hyperdrive binding in `wrangler.jsonc` with the ID from step 4:
   ```json
   "hyperdrive": [
     {
       "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
       "id": "YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_ID",
       "localConnectionString": "postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
     }
   ]
   ```
6. Build the application with `npm run build`
7. Deploy with `npm run deploy`
8. Monitor your worker with `npm wrangler tail`

### Option 2: Without Database (Demo Mode)

1. Run `npm i`
2. Keep the Hyperdrive binding commented out in `wrangler.jsonc` (this is the default)
3. Build the application with `npm run build`
4. Deploy with `npm run deploy`
5. The app will automatically use mock data instead of a real database

## Setting Up Hyperdrive Bindings

Hyperdrive is Cloudflare's database connector that provides optimized connections between your Workers and various database providers. Here's a detailed explanation of how to set it up:

1. **Create a Hyperdrive configuration**:

   ```
   npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-hyperdrive-config --connection-string="postgres://user:password@hostname:port/dbname"
   ```

   This command will return a Hyperdrive ID that you'll need for your configuration.

2. **Configure Hyperdrive in wrangler.jsonc**:

   ```json
   "hyperdrive": [
     {
       "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",  // Name used to access the binding in your code
       "id": "YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_ID",  // ID from the create command
       "localConnectionString": "postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase"  // Local dev connection
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Access in your code**:

   ```javascript
   // Example from this project
   if (c.env.HYPERDRIVE) {
   	const sql = postgres(c.env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);
   	// Use SQL client
   }
   ```

4. **Fallback handling**: This application automatically falls back to mock data if:
   - Hyperdrive binding is not configured
   - Database connection fails for any reason

## Running Locally

To run locally, you can use the Docker container defined in the docker compose:

1. `docker-compose up -d`
   - Creates container with PostgreSQL and seeds it with the "init.sql" data
2. `npm run dev`

If you update the "init.sql" file, make sure to run `docker-compose down -v` to teardown.

### Why Docker is Required for Local Development

When developing locally with Hyperdrive, you **must** use the Docker setup provided:

1. **Local connection requirements**: Hyperdrive's local development mode requires a database running on localhost with the exact configuration specified in `localConnectionString`
2. **Compatibility**: The Docker setup ensures the PostgreSQL instance is properly configured to work with the local Hyperdrive development environment
3. **Automatic configuration**: The container automatically runs the init.sql script to create tables and load sample data
4. **Connection reliability**: The Docker setup guarantees consistent connection behavior between your local Wrangler environment and the database
5. **Development/production parity**: Using Docker ensures your local development closely resembles the production environment

This approach is the recommended and supported method for local development with this application. Attempting to use a remote database for local development with Hyperdrive is not currently supported, but is being worked on.

- **No configuration needed:** Smart Placement works automatically when enabled in `wrangler.jsonc` with `"mode": "smart"`.

<!-- dash-content-end -->

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + React Router for client-side navigation [using declarative routing](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview)
  - Built with Vite and deployed as static assets via Workers
  - React SPA mode enabled in `wrangler.jsonc` for client-side navigation

- **Backend**: API routes served by a Worker using [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
  - API endpoints defined in `/api/routes` directory
  - Automatic fallback to mock data when database is unavailable

- **Database**: PostgreSQL database connected via Cloudflare Hyperdrive
  - Smart Placement enabled for optimal performance
  - Handles missing connection strings or connection failures

## Get Started

To run the applicaton locally, use the Docker container defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

1. `docker-compose up -d`
   - Creates container with PostgreSQL and seeds it with the data found in `init.sql`
2. `npm run dev`

If you update `init.sql`, be sure to run `docker-compose down -v` to teardown the previous image.

### Setting Up Hyperdrive Bindings

Cloudflare's Hyperdrive is database connector that optimizes queries from your Workers to various database providers using a connection string. Here's a detailed explanation of how to set it up:

1. **Create a Hyperdrive configuration**:

   ```sh
   npx wrangler hyperdrive create my-hyperdrive-config --connection-string="postgres://user:password@hostname:port/dbname"
   ```

   This command will return the Hyperdrive ID that you'll need for your configuration.

2. **Configure Hyperdrive in wrangler.jsonc**:

   ```json
   "hyperdrive": [
     {
       "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",  // Name used to access the binding in your code
       "id": "YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_ID",  // ID from the create command
       "localConnectionString": "postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase"  // Local dev connection
     }
   ]
   ```

3. **Access in your code**:

   ```javascript
   // Example from this project
   if (c.env.HYPERDRIVE) {
   	const sql = postgres(c.env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString);
   	// Use SQL client
   }
   ```

4. **Fallback handling**: This application automatically falls back to mock data if:
   - Hyperdrive binding is not configured
   - Database connection fails for any reason

For a more detailed walkthrough, see the [Hyperdrive documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/hyperdrive/configuration/connect-to-postgres/).

### More on Docker's Use in Local Development

When developing locally with Hyperdrive, you **must** use the Docker setup provided. This is because Hyperdrive's local dev mode requires a database running on localhost with the exact configuration specified in `localConnectionString`.

The Docker setup in this template ensures the PostgreSQL instance is properly configured to work with Hyperdrive locally. The container automatically runs `init.sql` to create tables and load sample data.

While remote database use in local dev with Hyperdrive is not currently supported, it is being worked on.

## Ways to Deploy

There are two different ways to deploy this application: Full Experience and Demo Mode.

### Option 1: With Database (Full Experience)

1. Run `npm i`
2. Sign up for a PostgreSQL provider and create a database
   - Quickstart options: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/)
3. Load the sample data using the provided SQL script:
   - The `/init.sql` file contains all database schema and sample data
   - You can either:
     - Copy and paste the contents into your database provider's SQL editor
     - Or use a command line tool like `psql`: `psql -h hostname -U username -d dbname -f init.sql`
4. Create a Hyperdrive connection by running:
   ```sh
   npx wrangler hyperdrive create <YOUR_CONFIG_NAME> --connection-string="<postgres://user:password@HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT/database_name>"
   ```
5. Uncomment and update the Hyperdrive binding in `wrangler.jsonc` with the ID from step 4:
   ```json
   "hyperdrive": [
     {
       "binding": "HYPERDRIVE",
       "id": "YOUR_HYPERDRIVE_ID",
       "localConnectionString": "postgresql://myuser:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase"
     }
   ]
   ```
6. Deploy with `npm run deploy`

### Option 2: Without Database (Demo Mode)

1. Run `npm i`
2. Keep the Hyperdrive binding commented out in `wrangler.jsonc` (this is the default)
3. Deploy with `npm run deploy`
4. The app will automatically use mock data instead of a real database

# Multiplayer Globe App

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/multiplayer-globe-template)

![Multiplayer Globe Template Preview](https://imagedelivery.net/wSMYJvS3Xw-n339CbDyDIA/43100bd9-8e11-4c20-cc00-3bec86253f00/public)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

Using the power of [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/), this example shows website visitor locations in real-time. Anyone around the world visiting the [demo website](https://multiplayer-globe-template.templates.workers.dev) will be displayed as a dot on the globe! This template is powered by [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/).

## How It Works

Each time someone visits the page, a WebSocket connection is opened with a Durable Object that manages the state of the globe. Visitors are placed on the globe based on the geographic location of their IP address, which is exposed as a [property on the initial HTTP request](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties) that establishes the WebSocket connection.

The Durable Object instance that manages the state of the globe runs in one location, and handles all incoming WebSocket connections. When a new connection is established, the Durable Object broadcasts the location of the new visitor to all other active visitors, and the client adds the new visitor to the globe visualization. When someone leaves the page and their connection is closed, the Durable Object similarly broadcasts their removal. The Durable Object instance remains active as long as there is at least one open connection. If all open connections are closed, the Durable Object instance is purged from memory and remains inactive until a new visitor lands on the page, opens a connection, and restarts the lifecycle.

## More on Durable Objects

In this template, only one Durable Object instance is created, since all visitors should see updates from all other visitors, everywhere in the world. A more complex version of this application could instead show a map of the country the visitor is located in, and only display markers for other visitors who are located in the same country. In this case, a Durable Object instance would be created for each country, and the client would connect to and receive updates from the Durable Object instance corresponding to the visitor's country.

For this example, Durable Objects are used for synchronizing but not storing state. Since visitor connections are ephemeral, and tied to the in-memory lifespan of the Durable Object instance, there's no need to use persistent storage. However, a more complex version of this application could display the all-time visitor count, which needs to be persisted beyond the in-memory lifespan of the Durable Object. In this case, the Durable Object code would use the [Durable Object Storage API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/storage-api/) to persist the value of the counter.

- üîé Built-in Observability logging
<!-- dash-content-end -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/templates.git
   cd templates/llm-chat-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Worker type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

### Development

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8787.

Note: Using Workers AI accesses your Cloudflare account even during local development, which will incur usage charges.

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Monitor

View real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker:

```bash
npm wrangler tail
```

## Project Structure

```

## How It Works

### Backend

The backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and uses the Workers AI platform to generate responses. The main components are:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/chat`): Accepts POST requests with chat messages and streams responses
2. **Streaming**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of AI responses
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` constant in `src/index.ts`. You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

Learn more about [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.

# Durable Objects Starter

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/hello-world-do-template)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

This is a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) starter template. It comes with a `sayHello` method that returns `Hello World!`.

<!-- dash-content-end -->

Outside of this repo, you can start a new project with this template using [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI):

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template=cloudflare/templates/hello-world-do-template
```

## Getting Started

First, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Then run the development server (using the package manager of your choice):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the project by modifying `src/index.ts`.

# Durable Chat App

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/durable-chat-template)

![Template Preview](https://imagedelivery.net/wSMYJvS3Xw-n339CbDyDIA/da00d330-9a3b-40a2-e6df-b08813fb7200/public)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

With this template, you can deploy your own chat app to converse with other users in real-time. Going to the [demo website](https://durable-chat-template.templates.workers.dev) puts you into a unique chat room based on the ID in the url. Share that ID with others to chat with them! This is powered by [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) and [PartyKit](https://www.partykit.io/).

## How It Works

Users are assigned their own chat room when they first visit the page, and can talk to others by sharing their room URL. When someone joins the chat room, a WebSocket connection is opened with a [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) that stores and synchronizes the chat history.

The Durable Object instance that manages the chat room runs in one location, and handles all incoming WebSocket connections. Chat messages are stored and retrieved using the [Durable Object SQL Storage API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/sql-storage/). When a new user joins the room, the existing chat history is retrieved from the Durable Object for that room. When a user sends a chat message, the message is stored in the Durable Object for that room and broadcast to all other users in that room via WebSocket connection. This template uses the [PartyKit Server API](https://docs.partykit.io/reference/partyserver-api/) to simplify the connection management logic, but could also be implemented using Durable Objects on their own.

# Worker + D1 Database

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/d1-template)

![Worker + D1 Template Preview](https://imagedelivery.net/wSMYJvS3Xw-n339CbDyDIA/cb7cb0a9-6102-4822-633c-b76b7bb25900/public)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

D1 is Cloudflare's native serverless SQL database ([docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)). This project demonstrates using a Worker with a D1 binding to execute a SQL statement. A simple frontend displays the result of this query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM comments LIMIT 3;
```

The D1 database is initialized with a `comments` table and this data:

```SQL
INSERT INTO comments (author, content)
VALUES
    ('Kristian', 'Congrats!'),
    ('Serena', 'Great job!'),
    ('Max', 'Keep up the good work!')
;
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using C3 to create this project, select "no" when it asks if you want to deploy. You need to follow this project's [setup steps](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/d1-template#setup-steps) before deploying.

# d1-starter-sessions-api

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/d1-starter-sessions-api-template)

<!-- dash-content-start -->

Starter repository using Cloudflare Workers with D1 database and the new [D1 Sessions API for read replication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/#use-sessions-api).

## What is the demo?

This demo simulates purchase orders administration.
There are two main actions you can do.

1. Create an order with a `customerId`, `orderId`, and `quantity`.
2. List all orders.

The UI when visiting the deployed Worker project shows 3 buttons.

- **Create order & List**
  - Creates a new order using the provided customer ID with a random order ID and quantity.
  - Does a `POST /api/orders` request to the Worker, and its handler uses the Sessions API to do an `INSERT` first for the new order that will be forwarded to the primary database instance, followed by a `SELECT` query to list all orders that will be executed by nearest replica database.
- **List orders**
  - Lists every order recorded in the database.
  - Does a `GET /api/orders` request to the Worker, and its handler uses the Sessions API to do a `SELECT` query to list the orders that will be executed by the nearest replica database.
- **Reset**
  - Drops and recreates the orders table.
  - Gets executed by the primary database.

The UI JavaScript code maintains the latest `bookmark` returned by the API and sends it along every subsequent request.
This ensures that we have sequential consistency in our observed database results and all our actions are properly ordered.

Read more information about how the Sessions API works, and how sequential consistency is achieved in the [D1 read replication documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/).

## Deploy

1. Checkout the project locally.
2. Run `npm ci` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy to your Cloudflare account.
4. Visit the URL you got in step 3.

## Local development

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

# Templates for Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers let you deploy serverless code instantly across the globe for exceptional performance, reliability, and scale. This repository contains a collection of starter templates for building full-stack applications on Workers. **You are encouraged to use, modify, and extend this code!**

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start building with a template in this repository: the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and [C3](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/) (the `create-cloudflare` CLI).

### Starting from the Dashboard

After logging in or signing up through the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), open the [Workers templates page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/templates) and select a template to get started with. From here, you can create a repository and deploy your first Worker without needing a local development environment.

### Starting via CLI

To get started locally, run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest
# or
pnpm create cloudflare@latest
# or
yarn create cloudflare@latest
```

For more information on getting started with our CLI, check out the [getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).

### Additional Resources

Questions about Workers? Join the [official Cloudflare Discord](https://workers.community/) or check out the [Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)!

## End-to-End Testing

This repository includes a comprehensive Playwright-based E2E test suite that validates all templates to ensure they work correctly. The test system supports both **local development mode** (spinning up dev servers) and **live mode** (testing against deployed templates).

### Running E2E Tests

#### Local Development Mode (Default)

By default, tests run against locally started development servers:

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
pnpm run test:e2e

# Run tests for specific templates
pnpm run test:e2e astro-blog-starter-template.spec.ts
pnpm run test:e2e saas-admin-template.spec.ts

# Run tests with UI mode for debugging
pnpm run test:e2e --ui
```

In local mode:

- Tests start development servers automatically for each template
- Uses one worker to prevent port conflicts
- Servers are properly cleaned up between different template tests
- Longer timeouts to account for build and startup time

#### Live Mode (Testing Deployed Templates)

To test against live deployed templates, set the `PLAYWRIGHT_USE_LIVE` environment variable:

```bash
# Run tests against live deployed templates
pnpm run test:e2e:live

# Run specific template tests in live mode
pnpm run test:e2e:live saas-admin-template.spec.ts
```

In live mode:

- Tests run against `https://{template-name}.templates.workers.dev`
- Enables parallel execution (up to 4 workers locally, 2 in CI)
- Faster execution since no local server startup required
- Shorter timeouts since templates are already running

### Test Architecture

The test system includes:

- **Automatic template discovery**: Finds all `*-template` directories and analyzes their framework
- **Smart server management**: Detects framework type (Astro, Next.js, Vite, etc.) and uses appropriate ports
- **Reliable cleanup**: Properly terminates process trees between test runs
- **Flexible URL resolution**: Automatically determines live URLs from `wrangler.json` configuration

### Writing Template Tests

Template tests should be named `{template-name}.spec.ts` and placed in the `playwright-tests/` directory:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "./fixtures";

test.describe("My Template", () => {
	test("should render correctly", async ({ page, templateUrl }) => {
		await page.goto(templateUrl);
		await expect(page.getByRole("heading", { name: "Welcome" })).toBeVisible();
	});
});
```

The `templateUrl` fixture automatically provides the correct URL (local dev server or live deployment) based on the test mode.

#### Playwright Codegen

Playwright includes a test code generation utility that records your actions in a chromium browswer. To start the codegen utility run

```bash
pnpm playwright codgen
```
